# Feature Scaling

#### **What is Fature Scaling?**
> Feature scaling is *a technique for standardising the independent characteristics included in data within a specific range*. It is used during data pre-processing *to deal with drastically changing magnitudes, values, or units*. If feature scaling is not performed, a machine learning algorithm will tend to weight bigger values as higher and consider smaller values as lower, regardless of the unit of measurement.
